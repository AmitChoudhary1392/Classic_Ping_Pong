# Classic_Ping_Pong

>Classic Ping Pong Game using Python and Turtle Graphics.  
Turtle Graphics is a pre-installed Python library and a trendy way to visualize what programming can do.

> To create the Ping Pong Game using Python and Turtle Graphics, it is divided into following tasks-
> * ***Task-1:*** Build the game window and initialize the game's main loop.
>>![InitialWindow](/Assets/Images/InitialGameWindow.png)
>
> * ***Task-2:*** Create the two paddles and the ball.

>
> * ***Task-3:*** Move the paddles with the keyboard
>>![PaddleMove](/Assets/Images/PaddleMove.png)
>
> * ***Task-4:*** Move the ball and constrain its movement
>>![BAllMove](/Assets/Images/BallMove.png)
>
> * ***Task-5:*** Bounce the ball back when it collides with the paddles
>>![BallBounce](/Assets/Images/BallBounce.png)
>
> * ***Task-6:*** Add a scoring system to the game
>>![Scoreboard](/Assets/Images/Scoreboard.png)



> ### Game In Action

> A few of the ***functions*** used from Turtle Graphics
> * `Turtle`: to intiatle Turtle objects
> * `speed`: sets speed of animation, takes "time" as argument. 0 sets max speed
> * `penup`: use turtle object without a trace
> * `hideturtle`: hides the turtle object and leaves no trace
> * `xcor` & `ycor` : gets x & y coordinate of turtle object
> * `goto`: sets new position for turtle object
> * `setx` & `sety`: changes x & y coordinates
> * `dx` & `dy`: change in coordinates. can be used to define diagonal movement of the turtle
> * `write`: write using a turtle object. Takes string, position and font as argument
> * `clear`: clear the turtle object trace. if not used before `write`, results will overwrite with visible turtle trace.


> ### Further Enhancements:
>
> - Add **constraints to restrict** paddle movement with respect to window boundary limit
>
> - Add **skill level** feature and **dynamic speed** change for ball motion
>
> - Add **inputs** to customize player names
>
> - Add **dynamic code** to adjust the border constraints with respect to the game window size.
